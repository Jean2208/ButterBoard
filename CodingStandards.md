# Coding Standards Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for this project. It aims to promote code consistency, enhance maintainability, and facilitate collaboration across the development team.

## 1. Naming Conventions

**Variables:** Use meaningful and descriptive names, following `camelCase` for variables.
    
 Example:
 ```const smallNumber = 1```

**Functions/Methods:** Use descriptive verbs and follow `camelCase`.

Example:
```const fetchData = () => {}```

**Classes:** Use `PascalCase` and nouns.

Example:
```class UserData {}```

## 2. Comments and Documentation

**Inline Comments:** Use for complex code sections, but prefer clear code over comments.

**Function/Method Comments:** If the function/method is complex, document the purpose, parameters, and return values.

Example:
```
/*
 * Fetches data from the server.
 * @param {String} url - The URL to fetch data from.
 * @return {Promise} - A promise that resolves with the fetched data.
 */
const fetchData = (url) => {}
```

## 3. Version Control Practices

**Commits:** Commit messages must follow the convention listed in this website https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary. Commit verbs must be in present tense.

Example:
```
fix: prevent racing of requests
```

**Branching:** Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes, merging back to the main branch upon completion.

## 4. Error Handling

**Custom Errors:** Create meaningful error messages for better error management.

Example:
```
if (!user) { 
throw  new  Error('User not found. Ensure the user ID is correct and try again.') 
}
```

## 5. Security Practices

**Input Validation:** Never trust input; validate and sanitize user input rigorously.

**Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## 6. Performance Considerations

**Optimization:** When using React, divide pages into components wherever possible to make loading time more efficient when updating state.

## 7. Styling and CSS

**Class and ID Names:** Use lowercase and separate words with hyphens to enhance readability.

Example:
```
/* This is a CSS class */
.menu-item { 
	... 
}

/* This is a CSS ID */
#header-content {
	...
}
```

**Responsive Design:** All CSS styling must be responsive by using a **Desktop-First Approach**. A responsive website adjusts its layout and content to fit different screen sizes and devices, like smartphones, tablets, and desktops, for better viewing and usability.

Example:
```
.selector {
    /* Default styles for desktop */
}

@media (max-width: 767px) {
    .selector {
        /* Override styles for mobile */
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Adhering to these coding standards will help ensure that our project is maintainable, scalable, and accessible to new team members. Regular reviews and updates to this document are encouraged to accommodate project evolution and new best practices.
